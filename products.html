    <h1>About the band</h1>
<h3>If The Beths and Same Name Confusion came together in a Scott Pilgrim vs The World type stand off it would sound almost exactly like Sure Boy. A perfectly harmonised rant about ‘evil exes’, unfortunate encounters on the San Fran balcony and a song about enjoying eating lemons for good measure.</h3>

<h3>For a more literal depiction of Sure Boy, they are an all female Wellington band with an alternative pop rock sound, made up of Simone McCarthy (Guitar/Vox), Freyja Appleyard (Drums), Lily Fulton (Bass/Guitar) and Beth Steward (Main Vox/Bass). They formed in early 2020 which turned out to be incredible unlucky timing to start a new band. Almost as soon as they had put together an EP and were ready to start playing live, New Zealand went into a month-long lockdown and the thought of going to a real gig seemed like a distant dream. Finally, now that the covid cloud seems to be lifting, Sure Boy is recording their first EP and has an array of live performances lined up over the coming year.</h3>
